<p>Have you ever used a computer? If you haven't then you live under a literal rock, or North Korea. Computers more or less look the same when you take them apart. Inside there is always a motherboard, RAM, processor, graphics card, and harddrive. Each of these play an important part in a computer's function.</p>
<h2 div style="text-align:center">A general overview of a computer</h2>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Harddrive:</td>
    <td><img style="width:100px" src="http://www.theinquirer.net/IMG/139/177139/wd-av-gp-harddrive-platter-spindle-hard-drive-seagate-ssd-solidstatedrive-deskstar-caviar-greenpower-raid-storage-pixiedust-hgst-hitachi-sata-cache-magnets.jpg" />Stores all the memory for later use, there are two types of harddrives, HDD or spinning harddrive (tradtional), these opperate by spinning, the faster the rotations per minute, the faster your computer can recall information. There is also SDD, or <strong>s</strong>olid <strong>s</strong>tate <strong>h</strong>arddrive. These work in a way so they can recall information instantly, the drawbacks however are they are new, therefore they are more expensive, rarer, and don't have as much storage than the older HDDs.</td>

    <td>CPU (central processing unit):</td>
    <td><img style="width:100px" src="http://cdn.eteknix.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DT_Haswell_i7_FB.jpg" />Computes everything, think of this as the brain of the computer, everything you do is controlled the the CPU, best ones are made by intel. The speed of these processors is measured by Gigahertz, the higher the number the faster the processor. Therefore the faster your computer is. </td>

Once our session is over the RAM will be cleared and the memory placed into the harddrive.</td>

    <p>Peripherals are things such as your mouse, headphones, keyboard and monitor. None of these are things you need to buy if you have a laptop, as they come built in. But if you own a desktop they are essential to your being able to use the computer. The mouse is what you use to control computer, the keyboard being what you use to type, and the monitor is the display your looking at right now. Some good makers of mice are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Razer</li>
      <li>Corsair</li>
      <li>Mad Catz</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However those are accessories, inside a computer it is much more complex. A table showing this can be found below.</p>
    
    
    
</table>

<p>Some other less importnat things are video and sound cards. The depending on your video card your computer will be able to run quicker with better graphics. The sound card is usually built into the motherboard, and just processes sound.</p>
