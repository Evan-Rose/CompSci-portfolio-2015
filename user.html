<p>Hello World! This is my website about me! I'm in 9th grade and my name is Evan. I've lived in California my whole life, but I've been to <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg">Italy</a> (Rome and Florence), <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Civil_and_Naval_Ensign_of_France.svg/1280px-Civil_and_Naval_Ensign_of_France.svg.png">France</a>, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png">Spain</a>, Hawaii, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China.svg/2000px-Flag_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China.svg.png"> China</a> and very, very briefly <a href="http://countries.bridgat.com/images/German_Flag.gif">Germany</a>.</p>
<h1>My interests</h1>
  <ol>
    
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <h4>Games I like</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Uncharted</li>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <li>Assassins Creed</li>
        <li>Kirby</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Biking</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
    <li>Computers</li>
  
      
  </ol>
  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is video games. But thats cliche, so lets talk about biking. I actually used to dislike biking for these reasons:
    
    <h3>Reasons why biking <strong style="color:red;font-size:35px"><em>sucked</em></strong> for me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It took too long</li>
      <li>It was boring!
      <li>My dad did it, which made it unapealing</li>
      <li>And I wanted to play video games more than I wanted to go on a bike ride</li>
    </ul>
    After a year I made an agreement, I would go on bikerides, and he would not bother me about games afterward. This weekend I'm going on a 60 mile ride. Now I have began to enjoy going on bike rides!</p>
    
    <h3>Reasons why bikging has become tolerable!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It makes my dad more lenient with my games</li>
      <li>It is a fun thing to do</li>
      <li>It's great exercise</li>
      <li>It's another thing I'm better than him at</li>
      <li>It's a fun way to get around</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One other interest I have (interest because I haven't done much with it yet) it computer building. Last year my friend built a computer with some money he saved up and made it out to be something really cool. So I looked into it and decided it looked cool too. So far I have learned what goes into a desktop, and what is more important for what kind of jobs your doing with it, I made a list of parts here.</p>
    <h3>Essential parts</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Processor</li>
      <li>Harddrive (HDD is cheaper)(SDD is better)</li>
      <li>Grahpics Card(everything you see is because of this)</li>
      <li>RAM(makes your computer faster)</li>
      <li>Monitor</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So ummm,I lied, we are going to talk about video games! I got my first gameboy when i was about 6 or 7. My dad bought it for me in preperation for a long, and boring flight to New Jersey to visit my grandparents. With said gameboy we bought a few games.</p>
    
    <H3><strong><em>My first games!</strong></em></H3>
    <ol>
      <li>Kirby's Adventure in Dreamland</li>
      <li>Kirby Magic Mirror</li>
      <li>Pokemon Emerald</li>
      <li>Pokemon Leaf Green</li>
      <li>Pokemon Saphire</li>
      <li>Lord of the Rings</li>
    </ol>
